## Task: 1 Predict the Percentage Scores of a student based on the number of hours studied.
Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning (Simple Linear Regression) In this task we have to predict the Percentage Scores of a student based on the number of hours studied. The task has two variables where the feature is the no. of hours studied and target value is the percentage of Scores. This can be solved by using Simple Linear Regression.

## Task 2: Using Unsupervised ML for the given IRIS flower dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Task3:To Perform "Exploratory Data Analysis" on a dataset of "SampleSuperStore".

As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make profit.

What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Retailer (Superstore) is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers.

## Task4:Perform "Exploratory Data Analysis" on dataset "Global Terrorism"

As a security/defense analyst, try to find out hot zone of terrorism.
What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

From article on terrorism

Over the past decade, terrorists killed an average of 21,000 people worldwide each year.

The global death toll from terrorism over the past decade ranged from 8,000 in 2010 to a high of 44,000 in 2014.

In 2017, terrorism was responsible for 0.05% of global deaths.

Terrorism tends to be very geographically-focused: 95% of deaths in 2017 occurred in the Middle East, Africa or South Asia.

In most countries terrorism accounts for less than 0.01% of deaths, but in countries of high-conflict, this can be as much as several percent.

Airline hijackings were once common but are very rare today.

Public concern about terrorism is high – in many countries more than half say they are concerned about being a victim.

Media coverage of terrorism is often disproportionate to its frequency and share of deaths.

## Task5:Perform "Exploratory Data Analysis" on dataset "Indian Premier League"

As a sport analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factor contributing win or loss of a team.
Suggest team or players a company should endorse for its products.
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional men's Twenty20 cricket league, contested by ten teams based out of ten Indian cities. The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. It is usually held between March and May of every year and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.

## Task6 : Create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically.

The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
