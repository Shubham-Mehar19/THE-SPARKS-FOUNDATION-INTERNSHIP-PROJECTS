From article on terrorism

Over the past decade, terrorists killed an average of 21,000 people worldwide each year.

The global death toll from terrorism over the past decade ranged from 8,000 in 2010 to a high of 44,000 in 2014.

In 2017, terrorism was responsible for 0.05% of global deaths.

Terrorism tends to be very geographically-focused: 95% of deaths in 2017 occurred in the Middle East, Africa or South Asia.

In most countries terrorism accounts for less than 0.01% of deaths, but in countries of high-conflict, this can be as much as several percent.

Airline hijackings were once common but are very rare today.

Public concern about terrorism is high â€“ in many countries more than half say they are concerned about being a victim.

Media coverage of terrorism is often disproportionate to its frequency and share of deaths.
