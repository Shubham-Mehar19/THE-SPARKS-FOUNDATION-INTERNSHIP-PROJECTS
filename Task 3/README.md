# Task3:To Perform "Exploratory Data Analysis" on a dataset of "SampleSuperStore".

As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make profit.

What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

Retailer (Superstore) is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers.
